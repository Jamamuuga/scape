# Scape Terrain Editor

Scape is a terrain editor which can be used to create and sculpture
virtual terrains. This terrains can be exported into heightmaps and can
be reused in 3d applications such as games.

This was originally a fork of Giliam de Carpentier's
[Scape](http://www.decarpentier.nl/scape) terrain editor which has been
ported to Qt (from wxWidgets) and updated to work with the latest OGRE
version.

It was also extended by some features that were not available in the
original.

This editor is pretty usable but it could still handle some
improvements.
